## Database Models

| Model | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Event` | Events with type, date, location, deadline |
| `Beschikbaarheid` | Per-user availability response per event |
| `EventUitnodiging` | Which users are invited to an event |
| `EventHerinnering` | Scheduled reminder config per event |
| `EventHerinneringLog` | Per-user reminder delivery log (event + user + timestamp) |
| `Post` | Information posts with categories |
| `PostFile` | File attachments on posts |
| `Comment` | Polymorphic comments on events/posts/tasks |
| `TaskGroup` | Grouping for tasks |
| `Task` | Tasks with status, assignment, claiming |
| `Notification` | In-app notifications |

---

## Key Patterns

- **Server Components** by default; `"use client"` only where needed (forms, interactivity)
- **Server Actions** for all mutations (`"use server"` in action files)
- **Form pattern**: `useActionState` + native `<form action={}>` + `FormData` + Zod validation
- **Auth**: `requireAdmin()` for admin-only actions, `getCurrentUserId()` for any user
- **Notifications**: `notifyMembers()`, `notifyAdmins()`, `notifySpecificUsers()` helpers
- **Email**: All email sends wrapped in try/catch with `RESEND_API_KEY` guard — failures never break the main action
- **User resolution**: Clerk user IDs stored in DB, resolved via `resolveUsers()` at render time

---

## Phase 1 (Complete) — MVP

- Clerk authentication (Dutch localization)
- Events CRUD with availability tracking (3 states + mandatory reason)
- Information center (posts, categories, search, pinning, file attachments)
- Contextual comments on events, posts, and tasks
- Tasks with groups, claiming, completion
- Dashboard with next event hero, pending events, recent posts, open tasks
- Notification system (in-app)
- Admin page with team member role management + task group management
- Responsive design (mobile-first)

## Phase 2 (Complete) — Invitations, Email, Stats

### Event Invitations
- `EventUitnodiging` join table — admins select which members to invite per event
- `MemberPicker` component with "Alle leden" toggle vs manual selection
- Members only see events they're invited to; admins see all
- Response ratio based on invited count (not global member count)
- "Niet gereageerd" section shows non-responders on event detail

### Email Notifications (Resend)
- Event invite emails sent on event creation
- Task assignment emails sent when `toegewezenAan` is set
- Reminder emails sent via daily cron to non-responders
- Templates: `nieuw-evenement`, `herinnering`, `taak-toegewezen`
- Sending domain: configured in `src/lib/email.ts` (`FROM_EMAIL`)

### Automated Reminders
- `EventHerinnering` records created per event (configurable: 2/3/5/2+5 days after creation)
- Reminder timing changed from "days before deadline" to "days after event creation" (`dagenNaAanmaak`)
- Vercel cron at `/api/cron/herinneringen` runs daily at 08:00 UTC
- Sends email + in-app `HERINNERING` notification to non-responders
- Auth: `CRON_SECRET` header verification

### Per-User Reminder Tracking
- `EventHerinneringLog` model tracks which users received which reminders (per event, per user, with timestamp)
- Cron job creates a log entry for each user when a reminder is sent
- Event detail page shows bell icon with reminder count next to each user (both responders and non-responders)
- `AvailabilityOverview` component receives `herinneringLogs` prop and displays per-user counts
- `getEventById` query includes `herinneringLogs` relation

### Past/Upcoming Event Split
- Events page shows upcoming events by default
- Past events in collapsible "Afgelopen evenementen" section (muted styling)

### Task Assignment
- `<Select>` in task form to assign a member
- Assignee shown on task cards (avatar + name) and detail page
- `TAAK_TOEGEWEZEN` in-app notification + email on assignment

### Admin Stats Dashboard
- **Opkomst**: per member — invited, responded, beschikbaar, opkomst%
- **Afgeronde taken**: per member — completed task count
- **Responstijd**: per member — average hours to respond
- Located on Beheer page below team members and task groups

---

### End Time Simplification
- Event `eindtijd` field changed from full `datetime-local` input to `time` input only
- End time is stored as a full DateTime but only the time portion is used in the UI
- Event form uses `toTimeLocal()` helper to extract HH:MM from the stored DateTime

## Recent Session (2026-02-19) — Status & Open Issues

### What was done
1. **Reminder system refactored**: Changed from "days before deadline" to "days after creation" (`dagenNaAanmaak`)
2. **Per-user reminder tracking**: Added `EventHerinneringLog` model + bell indicators on event detail page
3. **End time simplified**: Changed from datetime-local to time-only input
4. **Email domain fix**: Corrected FROM_EMAIL typo from `viralize.ai` to `virtalize.ai`
5. **Debug logging**: Added then removed debug logging for email sending troubleshooting

### Resolved — PrismaClientValidationError
A `PrismaClientValidationError` was observed on the event detail page (`/evenementen/[id]`) because the dev server was running with a stale Prisma client after the `EventHerinneringLog` model was added. Fixed by running `npm run db:generate` and restarting the dev server. DB was already in sync.

### Untracked files (not committed)
- `scripts/seed-reminders.ts` — Seeds `EventHerinneringLog` entries for existing events (testing tool)
- `scripts/inspect-events.ts` — Inspects events with invitations, responses, and reminder logs (debugging tool)
- `scripts/seed-test-scenario.ts` — Creates a full test event with invited users, varied responses, and reminder logs
- `screenshots/` — Error screenshots from debugging session

---

## Phase 3 (Planned / Not Started)

- AI Assistant (chat interface with Anthropic Claude API + tool use)
- Push notifications (web push / PWA)
- Calendar integration (iCal export)
- Season overviews / reports
- Advanced file management

---

## Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Start dev server
npm run build        # Production build (includes prisma generate)
npm run lint         # ESLint
npm run db:generate  # Regenerate Prisma client
npm run db:push      # Push schema to DB (no migration history)
npm run db:migrate   # Create migration (dev)
npm run db:seed      # Seed database
```

---

## Deployment

- Push to `main` triggers automatic Vercel deployment
- Database schema changes: run `npx prisma db push` or deploy will use `prisma generate` in build script
- Cron jobs configured in `vercel.json`
- Make sure `RESEND_API_KEY` is set in Vercel environment variables
